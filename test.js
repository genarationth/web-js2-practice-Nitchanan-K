// // Challenge 1: Create an Age Calculator
// Store your birth year in a variable.
// Store a future year in another variable.
// Calculate your possible ages for the future year and display it in the console.
// Example: If you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you’ll be 37 or 38 (depending on the month in 2026).

my_birth_year = 1997;

future_year = 2030;

console.log(future_year - my_birth_year);


// Challenge 2: Create an information card
// Create a card holding 3 pieces of information about a person, such as Name, Location, and Hobby.
// Each piece of information should be a variable.
// Display the card with the information in the correct place.
// Example: “Hi, my name is John. I live in South Africa and enjoy drinking homemade wine.”

let Name = "Tee";
let location = "Phuket";
let hobby = "Running";

console.log("Hi, my name is " + Name + ". I live in " + location + " and enjoy " + hobby + ".");
